## Technical Implementation Details

### Category Structure
```javascript
const mainCategories = {
  'Photography': [],
  'Legal': [],  
  'Moving': [],
  'Finance': [],
  'Insurance': [],
  'Cleaning': [],
  'Construction': ['HVAC', 'Plumbing', 'Electrical', 'Roofing', 'Flooring', 'Painting'],
  'Maintenance': ['Garden', 'Pool', 'Security']
};
```

### Navigation Filtering
```javascript
categories.filter((category) => {
  const specializations = ['Plumbing', 'Electrical', 'HVAC', 'Roofing', 'Flooring', 'Painting', 'Garden', 'Pool', 'Security'];
  return !specializations.includes(category);
})
```

### Form Submission Logic
```javascript
serviceCategory: data.subCategory || data.serviceCategory
```

## Testing Verification
- Services dropdown shows only 3 main categories (plus All Services)
- Services page grid displays non-redundant categories
- Registration form shows subcategories dynamically
- Construction providers successfully added to database
- All navigation links properly filter by category

## Next Steps for Version 2
1. Complete git repository backup
2. Test all Services functionality thoroughly
3. Consider additional platform enhancements
4. Plan deployment strategy
