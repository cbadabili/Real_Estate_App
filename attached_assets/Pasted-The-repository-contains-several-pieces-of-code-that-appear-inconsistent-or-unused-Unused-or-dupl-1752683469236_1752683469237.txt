The repository contains several pieces of code that appear inconsistent or unused.

Unused or duplicate backend functions
Duplicate router functions
server/property-management-routes.ts exports a router instance and then redeclares a separate createPropertyManagementRoutes function after export default router:

226      });
227    }
228  });
229
230  export default router;
231  import express from 'express';
232  import { RentalStorage } from './rental-storage';
233
234  export function createPropertyManagementRoutes(): express.Router {
235    const router = express.Router();
236    const rentalStorage = new RentalStorage();

Tenant support routes duplication
server/tenant-support-routes.ts follows the same pattern—exporting a router and then defining createTenantSupportRoutes which isn’t used anywhere:

170  export default router;
171  import express from 'express';
172
173  export function createTenantSupportRoutes(): express.Router {
174    const router = express.Router();

Unused parameters
createRentalRoutes accepts a database argument but ignores it, instantiating RentalStorage with the globally imported db instead:

4  import type { db as DrizzleDB } from './db';
...
6  export function createRentalRoutes(db: typeof DrizzleDB): express.Router {
7    const router = express.Router();
8    const rentalStorage = new RentalStorage();

Placeholder functions
At the end of server/marketplace-routes.ts there are helper functions (createProviderReview, getProviderReviews) that aren’t referenced:

608  async function createProviderReview(data: any) {
...
616  async function getProviderReviews(providerId: number, options: any) {
617    return [];
618  }
619
620  export default router;

Unused storage module
server/marketplace-storage.ts defines a full MarketplaceStorage class and exports marketplaceStorage, but no other file imports it.

Unused frontend components
Several components exist without any imports elsewhere in client/src:

ChatWidget.tsx – defined but not included in any page or layout. 

ServicesShowcase.tsx – only the component file itself references this name. 

TestingDashboard.tsx – declared but not used. 

MortgageCalculatorWithAd.tsx – defined but never imported. 

Cleaning or integrating these components would reduce dead code.

Existing route for Map Search
The application now includes a route for /map-search:

134              <Route path="/secure-transactions" element={<SecureTransactionsPage />} />
135              <Route path="/communication" element={<CommunicationPage />} />
136              <Route path="/agent-network" element={<AgentNetworkPage />} />
137              <Route path="/map-search" element={<MapSearchPage />} />

This addresses the earlier missing route noted in previous discussions.

Extraneous files
Directories such as attached_assets/ and files like backup-files-list.txt contain historical artifacts and logs that are not part of the application code. Removing or archiving them separately would keep the repository cleaner.

Summary

Duplicate router functions (createPropertyManagementRoutes, createTenantSupportRoutes) can be removed.

createRentalRoutes should either use its db argument or drop the parameter.

Unused helper functions and entire modules (e.g., marketplace-storage.ts) increase clutter.

Frontend components like ChatWidget and ServicesShowcase are defined but never imported.

Non-code files in attached_assets/ could be cleaned up.

Addressing these inconsistencies would streamline the codebase and make maintenance easier.
