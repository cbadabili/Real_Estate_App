Summary
The authentication middleware still trusts any numeric or user_ bearer token, and the optional guard just parseInts whatever arrives, so forged headers can impersonate arbitrary users without a valid JWT.

Critical user and listing mutation endpoints are exposed without authentication or authorization, letting attackers overwrite profiles, toggle saved properties, or edit/delete listings for other accounts.

Registration/login logic allows clients to self-activate administrative user types, logs password material, and mismatches email casing, undermining both account security and sign-in reliability.

Issues
The authenticate middleware falls back to parsing numeric IDs (or user_ prefixes) when JWT verification fails, and optionalAuthenticate unconditionally trusts any numeric bearer string. An attacker can therefore send Authorization: Bearer 1 (or similar) to hijack another account.

Suggested task
Require verified JWTs in auth middleware

Start task
PUT /api/users/:id is completely unauthenticated and pipes the entire request body into storage.updateUser, so anyone can flip role, userType, permissions, or isActive for any account.

Suggested task
Protect user update endpoint

Start task
GET /api/users/:id only uses optionalAuthenticate; if no token (or an attacker-supplied numeric header) is present, the handler still returns the full profile, including email and phone, for any user ID.

Suggested task
Require auth for user detail retrieval

Start task
During registration the server accepts client-provided userType and isActive flags, so a new account can self-register as an active admin-level user without oversight.

Suggested task
Enforce safe defaults in registration

Start task
The login flow logs the stored password hash prefix, the raw password length, and even the first three characters of the submitted password, leaking sensitive credential data to application logs.

Suggested task
Scrub sensitive logging from login handler

Start task
Emails are stored exactly as submitted during registration, but login lowercases the input and getUserByEmail lowercases the lookup. Registering with mixed-case email therefore prevents later logins.

Suggested task
Normalize email casing consistently

Start task
PUT and DELETE /api/properties/:id are exposed without any authentication or ownership checks, allowing anonymous callers to rewrite or remove any listing.

Suggested task
Lock down property mutation routes

Start task
All saved-property endpoints (POST, DELETE, and status check) accept path parameters without authentication, so anyone can tamper with any userâ€™s shortlist by guessing their ID.

Suggested task
Secure saved-property APIs
