I'll help you investigate the error in the rental search functionality. The error message indicates that there's an issue in the rental-storage.ts file at line 193 where it's trying to call the prepare method on an undefined object.

Let me check the relevant code files to understand what's happening:

Analyzed
rental-storage.ts#L180-200
Let me check the rental routes file to see how the search functionality is being called:

Analyzed
rental-routes.ts#L50-65
I can see the issue now. The error occurs because the SQLite database connection (this.db) is undefined when trying to prepare a statement in the 
searchRentals
 method. This typically happens if:

The database connection wasn't properly initialized
The database connection was closed before the search operation
The db parameter wasn't properly passed to the 
RentalStorage
 constructor
Let me check how the database is initialized in the main server file:

Analyzed
index.ts#L1-50
I see the issue now. The problem is in the database initialization. The error occurs because:

The database connection is being tested but not properly initialized before use
The database connection might be closing prematurely
The db instance might not be properly passed to the 
RentalStorage
 class
Let me check the database initialization file:

Analyzed
db.ts#L1-30
I see the issue now. The error is occurring because:

The database connection is being created with better-sqlite3 but then wrapped with drizzle ORM
The 
RentalStorage
 class is trying to use raw SQLite methods (prepare) on the drizzle-wrapped database instance
The drizzle database instance doesn't have the raw SQLite methods that the 
RentalStorage
 class is expecting
Let me fix this by updating the 
rental-storage.ts
 file to use drizzle's query builder instead of raw SQLite methods:

I've made several important changes to fix the error:

Updated the database initialization in the 
RentalStorage
 constructor to properly wrap the raw SQLite database with drizzle:
typescript
constructor(private db: Database) {
  // Initialize drizzle instance
  this.db = drizzle(db, { schema });
}
Replaced all raw SQLite queries with drizzle's query builder methods:
Using this.db.select() instead of raw SQL
Using drizzle's where, orderBy, eq, gte, 
lte
 methods instead of string concatenation
Using drizzle's insert, 
update
, 
delete
 methods instead of prepared statements
Added proper type safety and error handling throughout the queries
The error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'prepare')" was occurring because we were trying to use raw SQLite methods (prepare) on a database instance that had been wrapped by drizzle. The drizzle ORM provides its own query builder methods that we should be using instead.

These changes should resolve the error you're seeing. The code now properly uses drizzle's query builder interface instead of trying to use raw SQLite methods. Try running the application again - the rental search functionality should now work correctly.

If you encounter any other issues, please let me know and I'll help you resolve them.
