Objective:
Redesign the homepage navigation and hero section for a modern, user-focused real estate experience. Prioritize clarity, responsiveness, and engagement, while showcasing premium properties and agency partners.

Navigation Bar
Remove the “Home” tab; clicking the logo should always return the user to the homepage.

Replace “Dashboard” and “Properties” with two clear tabs:

Buy (for property buyers)

Rent (for property renters)

Keep “Map Search” as a main tab.

Change “Create Listing” to a single “Sell” tab. When clicked, open a modal or dropdown for:

“Sell a Property”

“Rent Out a Property”

Change “FSBO Dashboard” to “My Properties” (for users to manage their own listings).

Replace “Profile” with a circular avatar (showing user initials or uploaded photo). Clicking it opens a dropdown with account settings and sign-out.

AI Search Bar
Center the AI search bar both vertically and horizontally in the hero section for all screen sizes, including large desktops and ultrawide screens.

Use a responsive design (Flexbox/Grid) so the search bar and prompts always remain visually centered and balanced.

Make the search bar visually distinct with a contrasting background and subtle shadow, following modern search UX best practices.

Hero Section & Background
Replace the static blue background with a full-width, responsive slideshow/carousel of premium property images.

Overlay each slide with:

Property details (location, price, key features)

Agent’s photo, name, and contact info (inspired by Redfin’s listing cards)

Subtle dark gradient for text readability.

AI search bar and prompts should appear above the slideshow, always centered and readable.

Stats & Agency Carousel
Where you currently show stats (e.g., Active Listings, Happy Clients, Properties Sold), replace static numbers with a carousel or ticker:

Rotate through featured property agencies, showing their logo, a short tagline, and a link to their website.

Optionally, expand this in the future to include developers, service providers, or other industry players.

Each agency card should be clickable, opening their website in a new tab.

Other UI Enhancements
Ensure all elements are mobile-optimized and accessible.

Use clear, minimalist icons and intuitive labels for all navigation and action buttons.

Maintain a distraction-free, visually clean layout so users focus on property discovery.

Example Navigation Structure
| Logo | Buy | Rent | Map Search | Sell | My Properties | [Profile Avatar] |

Responsive CSS Reference:

Use Flexbox/Grid for centering and responsiveness

Ensure search bar and overlays adapt smoothly to all screen sizes

Future Expansion:

Agency carousel can later include developers, mortgage providers, and service partners.

Summary:
This redesign will create a visually engaging, intuitive homepage that guides users to buy, rent, or sell, while showcasing premium listings and trusted agencies—delivering a modern, Redfin-inspired experience tailored for your market.

You can hand this prompt directly to Cursor or your front-end team for implementation.
