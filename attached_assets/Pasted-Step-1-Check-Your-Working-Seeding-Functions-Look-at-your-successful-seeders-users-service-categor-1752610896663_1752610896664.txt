Step 1: Check Your Working Seeding Functions
Look at your successful seeders (users, service categories, marketplace providers). They likely use one of these patterns:
Pattern A: Drizzle ORM Methods
typescript// This is what your working seeders probably look like
await db.insert(users).values([
  { name: 'John', email: 'john@example.com' }
]);

// Or
await db.select().from(users).where(eq(users.id, 1));
Pattern B: Raw SQLite
typescript// This is what's causing your error
const stmt = db.prepare('INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES (?, ?)');
stmt.run('John', 'john@example.com');
Step 2: Check Your Database Connection Setup
Look for these files in your project:

server/database.ts or server/db.ts
server/schema.ts or similar

Your setup probably looks like:
typescript// Database setup (what you're likely using)
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/better-sqlite3';
import Database from 'better-sqlite3';

const sqlite = new Database('beedab.db');
export const db = drizzle(sqlite); // ← This is Drizzle instance

// NOT this (raw SQLite):
export const db = new Database('beedab.db'); // ← This has .prepare()
Step 3: Quick Diagnosis
Check your working seeders:

Look at server/user-seed.ts or similar working files
See if they use db.insert() or db.prepare()
Check what database instance they receive as parameter

Common patterns I expect to find:

Working seeders: Use db.insert(tableName).values(data)
Broken seeder: Uses db.prepare('INSERT INTO...')

Step 4: Fix Your rental-seed.ts
Once you confirm the pattern, update rental-seed.ts to match. Most likely:
typescript// Instead of:
const stmt = db.prepare('INSERT INTO rental_listings...');

// Use:
await db.insert(rentalListings).values([
  {
    property_id: 1,
    title: 'Modern Apartment',
    // ... other fields
  }
]);
Quick Check Commands
Run these in your project to identify the patterns:
bash# Check how other seeders work
grep -r "db\." server/*seed*.ts

# Check your database setup
cat server/database.ts  # or wherever your DB is configured

# Check your schema definitions
cat server/schema.ts
Can you share what you find in your working seeder files (like user-seed.ts or service-seed.ts)? This will help me give you the exact pattern to follow.
