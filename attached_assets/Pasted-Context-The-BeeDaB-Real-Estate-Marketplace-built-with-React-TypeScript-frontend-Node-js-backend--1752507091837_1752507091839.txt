Context:
The BeeDaB Real Estate Marketplace built with React (TypeScript) frontend, Node.js backend (Express), and SQLite using Drizzle ORM is facing repetitive import/export syntax errors:

Files (e.g., server/index.ts) repeatedly encounter errors like:

javascript
Copy
SyntaxError: The requested module './some-route-file' does not provide an export named 'someRoutes'
These errors consistently occur due to mismatched import/export types (default vs named exports).

Objective:
Provide a single, holistic fix addressing all the export/import inconsistencies throughout the backend API routes and frontend component imports.

🛠️ Holistic Implementation Steps
1. Backend Route Files (Express):
Review and ensure consistent exporting method (recommend default export):

Example route file (server/marketplace-routes.ts):

typescript
Copy
import { Router } from 'express';
const router = Router();

router.get('/categories', ...);
router.post('/register-provider', ...);

export default router; // ✅ Default export clearly defined
2. Server Index Imports (server/index.ts):
Review and ensure all route imports consistently use default import:

Example:

typescript
Copy
import marketplaceRoutes from './marketplace-routes'; // ✅ Correct
import rentalRoutes from './rental-routes';           // ✅ Correct
import propertyManagementRoutes from './property-management-routes'; // ✅ Correct
3. Verify Route Integration (Express app setup):
Clearly integrate imported routes into your Express server:

typescript
Copy
app.use('/api/marketplace', marketplaceRoutes);
app.use('/api/rentals', rentalRoutes);
app.use('/api/property-management', propertyManagementRoutes);
📌 Actionable Deliverables (Clearly define these):
 Audit all route files in server/ directory for consistent use of default exports.

 Audit all imports in server/index.ts and server/routes.ts for default import syntax.

 Clearly fix existing syntax errors caused by mismatched import/export.

 Verify all API routes (/api/...) are functioning correctly after fixing.

 Ensure server starts without errors (npm run start).

🔍 Testing and Validation (Clearly outlined):
After implementation:

 Run server (npm run start) without encountering syntax errors.

 Test each backend route (marketplace, rental, property management) via Postman or similar tools to ensure proper integration.

 Verify frontend components clearly fetch data from fixed backend routes without errors.

📝 Documentation & Consistency:
Update README clearly specifying the project's import/export guidelines.

Clearly state: "All Express router files use default exports; all route imports in server files use default import syntax."
