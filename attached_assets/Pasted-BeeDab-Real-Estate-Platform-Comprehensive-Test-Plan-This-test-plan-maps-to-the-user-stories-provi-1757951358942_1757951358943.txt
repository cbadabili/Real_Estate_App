BeeDab Real Estate Platform – Comprehensive Test Plan

This test plan maps to the user stories provided for BeeDab’s real‑estate marketplace. It covers the main roles (visitors, buyers, sellers/agents, landlords, tenants, service providers, and admins) and ensures that browsing is open to unregistered visitors while interactive features require registration and, where appropriate, a paid subscription. Tests also verify that entitlements (e.g., listing limits, hero slots) are enforced.

1. General Users & Authentication
1.1 Property search & filters

Search with valid filters – Set price range, property type, bedroom count and city; verify that only matching listings appear and that removing filters broadens results.

Search with no filters – Perform a search without filters; confirm that default sorting (e.g. by newest) is applied.

Invalid filter values – Enter negative price, zero bedrooms, or unsupported city; confirm that validation errors are shown and no results return.

Pagination / infinite scroll – For large result sets, navigate through pages or infinite scroll; ensure new results load and previously loaded ones remain accessible.

1.2 Property details page

View details – From the results list, click a property and verify that the detail page shows description, photos, location map, price, agent/seller contact info, and any embedded videos or 3D tours.

Breadcrumbs & navigation – Ensure back navigation returns to the search results with the same filter state.

Unavailable listing – Navigate to a removed or expired listing URL; expect a 404 or message that the property is no longer available.

1.3 Registration & login

Register with valid data – Create an account (email, password, name); expect a success message and redirection to dashboard. Check that a confirmation email (if implemented) is sent.

Duplicate email – Attempt to register with an existing email; the system should display an error without creating another account.

Weak password – Register with a too‑short or simple password; expect a validation error with password requirements.

Login with correct credentials – Use a registered email and password; expect successful authentication and access to the dashboard.

Login with incorrect credentials – Attempt to log in with a wrong password; expect an error and no access.

Password reset flow – Request a password reset; receive a reset email; complete the process; verify ability to log in with the new password.

1.4 Visitor access & plan visibility

Browse without login – Ensure visitors can search, view listings and read static pages (FAQs, pricing, tenant rights) without creating an account.

Prompt for plan on interactive actions – For actions like saving a property or posting a listing, confirm that the platform prompts the user to register and choose a plan rather than silently failing; this reflects UX guidance that users should be aware of subscription requirements early

3.1 Create listing with location validation

Valid listing – Create a new listing with title, description, address, price, photos and other required data; on submission, verify geolocation resolves correctly and the listing appears in search.

Missing fields – Omit required fields; expect the form to highlight missing fields and block submission.

Address validation – Enter an invalid or non‑existent address; the system should display an error or suggest corrections.

List reviews – Admin views all user and provider reviews; sort/filter by rating, date or flagged status.

Delete or hide review – Delete an inappropriate review; confirm it is removed from the public profile and the reviewer is notified (if implemented).

Restore review – If soft deletion is supported, restore a previously removed review and confirm it reappears.

Notes & assumptions

The plan assumes the monetisation rules discussed earlier: the Free plan allows one listing, Pro allows five, Premium allows unlimited and one hero slot, and Business is for agents/providers. Tests must verify that entitlements correspond to the latest features.

Payment flows are manual; thus testers should simulate admin approval to activate subscriptions and hero slots.

Cross‑device testing (desktop, tablet, mobile) is recommended to ensure responsive design and usability across devices.
