The error indicates that useEffect is not imported in the LoginPage.tsx file. Looking at the file, I can see that useEffect is being used but not imported from React.

clicking on the register button should just take me to the plans without first showing the options for registering without a plan

Looking at the screenshot, I can see that when someone clicks "Register" in the navbar or toggle, they're still being shown the registration form first instead of being taken directly to the pricing page to select a plan.

The issue is in the LoginPage.tsx where the registration form is still being displayed. Let me fix this by modifying the form submission to redirect to pricing instead of trying to register directly:

client/src/pages/LoginPage.tsx
Now let me also update the registration form to make it clearer that users need to select a plan first:

Now let me also simplify the registration form to just collect basic info and redirect to pricing:

Depending on the subscribe now button you click the next step should only show that option with the registration details option not showing all the plans.

I understand you want the registration modal to show only the selected plan when clicking "Subscribe Now" from the pricing page, rather than showing all plans for selection. Let me update the flow to achieve this.

I'll remove the register toggle button from the login form so users only see the login option and need to go to the pricing page to register.

Remove the link to pricing on the Navbar, its just okay as a feature 2. Remove the auctions link on the Navbar 3. On the pricing page provide for the following - provide a contact us for bulk listing for big agencies, where we will send a quotation for that (More like a lets grow together type custom page with properties still prioritized through other search functions), also do the same for auctions where there are options for options more live bulklistings. Aution listing is otherwise taken as a listing under any of the plans and reduces on the listing count

I'll help you make those changes to the navbar and enhance the pricing page with bulk listing and auction options. Let me implement these modifications:

client/src/components/layout/Navbar.tsx
client/src/pages/PricingPage.tsx
Assistant automatically restarted your App after applying file changes. You can disable this behavior in
